## Summary of Experiments
We conducted synthetic experiments as well as real-world data experiments to produce all plots and tables included in the paper.

1. Comparison of three different tensor-valued regression algorithms on synthetic data (Synthetic-data Experiments).
2. Comparison of five different regression algorithms, including three tensor-valued regression and two vector-valued regression methods, for predicting attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis (Real-data Experiments).

# Synthetic-data Experiments
The code for the synthetic experiments can be found in the `Synthetic` directory. The code for validation experiments is contained in the `val` directory, whereas the code for generatinbg the plots is contained in the `main` directory. The plots were generated using codes in the `main` directory, as explained below.

## Steps to reproduce the results
In order to reproduce Figure 1(a) in the paper, we ran the `SLR_test_glrsp_01.m`, `SLR_test_rauhut_01.m`, and `SLR_test_cp_01.m` files in the `noise 01` directory, which generated three separate `.mat` files in the same directory. The plot in Figure 1(a) was generated by running the `plot_noise_var_01.ipynb` file. Similarly, to reproduce Figure 1(b), we ran the `SLR_test_glrsp_04.m`, `SLR_test_rauhut_04.m`, and `SLR_test_cp_04.m` files in the `noise 04` directory, followed by generation of Figure 1(b) by running the `plot_noise_var_04.ipynb` file. Finally, to reproduce Figure 1(c), we ran the `SLR_test_glrsp_07.m`, `SLR_test_rauhut_07.m`, and `SLR_test_cp_07.m` files in the `noise 07` directory, followed by generation of Figure 1(c) by running the `plot_noise_var_07.ipynb` file. The histograms in Figure 1(d) can be obtained by running the `histogram_fails.m` file in the `noise 01` directory. The violin plots in Figure 1(e) were generated using the `violinplot_noise_01.ipynb` file in the `noise 01` directory.

# Real-data Experiments
The `Real` directory contains the code used to produce the results for ADHD diagnosis prediction experiments as described in the paper.

## Steps to reproduce the results
### Table II in the Paper: Performance of all Regression Algorithms

To perform the ADHD prediction experiments for Table II in the paper, we had one function `LSRImageDenoising.m` that was used for each image by passing in different parameters to the function. In order to speed up our computations, we ran the`LSRImageDenoising.m` function three times for each image and then concatenated our representation errors in all three `.mat` files that our function returned to give us results corresponding to a total of 25 Monte Carlo trials.
